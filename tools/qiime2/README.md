# QIIME 2 wrappers

These wrappers were developed as part of my internship at Medical University of Graz, Center for Medical Research. (https://zmf.medunigraz.at/, https://zmf.medunigraz.at/en/core-facilities/cf-computational-bioanalytics/)

## Thanks
My thanks to Marija Durdevic for support on wrapper development and testing.

Thanks to Slave Trajanoski, who explained general metagenomics terminology and Galaxy (https://usegalaxy.org/).

Thanks to Alexander Mahnert, who provided data and was a key figure while testing some of the more exotic qiime commands.
